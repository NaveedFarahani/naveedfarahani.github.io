Hi again! Thank you for exploring my site! As previously stated, I'm 4th year Chemical Engineering student at the University of Toronto. I also am pursuing a minor in Bioengineering. 

However, I'm not all academics! In my spare time, I love to stay active any way that I can. I'm a passionate soccer player and fan, but I'm willing to try any sport. Besides sports, I have an interesting in both digital and film photography. You can see some of my photos here! Like many others, I used to read a lot as a kid, and I'm currently trying to rekindle my interest in books, you can read about my thoughts on recent books I've read here!

I'm always looking to both learn and try new things, so if you have any suggestions on interesting topics, photography advice, or book recommendations, please reach out and share with me!
