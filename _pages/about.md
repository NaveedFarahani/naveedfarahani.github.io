Hi again! Thank you for exploring my site! As previously stated, I'm a Business Analyst within Deloitte's Systems Engineering practice. I graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in Chemical Engineering and a minor in Bioengineering. I'm currently looking for professional opportunities related to sustainability and tackling climate change. I'm most interested in using the analytical & technical skills I've learned during my academic and professional experiences to solve problems. The journey taken to go from problem to solution can be frustrating at times but is ultimately enjoyable. I've intentionally highlighted school projects that I felt were most challegnging from the perspective of being  multidisciplinary or involving more work than simple application of course concepts. 

However, I'm not all academics! In my spare time, I love to stay active any way that I can. I'm a passionate soccer player and fan, but I'm willing to try any sport. Besides sports, I have an interesting in both digital and film photography. You can see some of my photos [here!](https://naveedfarahani.github.io/photo)

I'm always looking to both learn and try new things, so if you have any suggestions on interesting topics, photography advice, or movie recommendations, please reach out and share with me!
