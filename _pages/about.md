Hi again! Thank you for exploring my site! As previously stated, I'm a Business Analyst within Deloitte's Systems Engineering practice. I graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in Chemical Engineering and a minor in Bioengineering. I'm currently looking for professional opportunities related to sustainability and tackling climate change. I'm most interested in using the analytical & technical skills I've learned during my academic and professional experiences to solve problems as the solutioning journey while frustrating at times, is ultimately enjoyable. I've intentionally highlighted school projects that I felt were most challenging from a multidisciplinary perspective and that involved more work than simply applying course concepts. 

However, I'm not all academics! In my spare time, I love to stay active any way that I can. I'm a passionate soccer player and fan, but I'm willing to try any sport. Besides sports, I have an interesting in both digital and film photography. You can see some of my photos [here!](https://naveedfarahani.github.io/photo)

I'm always looking to both learn and try new things, so if you have any suggestions on interesting topics, photography advice, or movie recommendations, please reach out and share with me!
