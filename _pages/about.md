Hi again! Thank you for exploring my site! As previously stated, I'm 4th year Chemical Engineering student at the University of Toronto. I also am pursuing a minor in Bioengineering. As mentioned I'm currently looking for professional employment opportunities for after graduation. I'm most interested in using the analytical skills I've learned during my time at UofT to solve problems. The journey taken to go from problem to solution can be frustrating at times but is ultimately enjoyable. Translating this to a professional setting, I view consulting as an opportunity to gain experience in multiple fields while doing what I enjoy most. I've intentionally highlighted school projects that I felt were more similar to consulting work and were also multidisciplinary or involved more work than simple application of course concepts. 

However, I'm not all academics! In my spare time, I love to stay active any way that I can. I'm a passionate soccer player and fan, but I'm willing to try any sport. Besides sports, I have an interesting in both digital and film photography. You can see some of my photos [here!](https://naveedfarahani.github.io/photo)

I'm always looking to both learn and try new things, so if you have any suggestions on interesting topics, photography advice, or movie recommendations, please reach out and share with me!
