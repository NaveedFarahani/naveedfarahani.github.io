**Course Description:**<br>
This was 3rd year course focused on teaching students how to effectively work within a team to solve a problem. In teams, we were expected to develop a design proposal for the successful production of a selected chemical. The project incorporated learned Chemical Engineering skills by necessitating the creation of researching and defining a chemical generation plan, PFDs, P&ID’s, operating procedures, and health and safety protocols.

**Project Description:**<br>
Our team specifically worked to create a design proposal for a facility that housed cyclohexanol production from 1-hexanol feedstock. Our work included the design of the reactor, the design of the distillation column, P&ID development, and the control strategies implemented to mitigate process deviations. Below is a screenshot from the Excel worksheet used to determine the reactor size we needed based on operational conditions.

**Reflection:**<br>
Project required applying knowledge that has been built in 2nd and 3rd year chemical engineering – successfully doing so helped to build confidence in my abilities as a chemical engineering student
