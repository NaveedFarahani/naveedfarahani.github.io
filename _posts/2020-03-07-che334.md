**Course Description:**<br>
This was 3rd year course focused on teaching students how to effectively work within a team to solve a problem. In teams, we were expected to develop a design proposal for the successful production of a selected chemical. The project incorporated learned Chemical Engineering skills by necessitating the creation of researching and defining a chemical generation plan, PFDs, P&IDâ€™s, operating procedures, and health and safety protocols.

**Project Description:**<br>
Our team specifically worked to create a design proposal for a facility that housed cyclohexanol production from 1-hexanol feedstock. Our work included the design of the reactor, the design of the distillation column, P&ID development, and the control strategies implemented to mitigate process deviations. Below is a screenshot from the Excel worksheet used to determine the reactor size we needed based on operational conditions.

**Reflection:**<br>
In comparison to previous course projects, this proposal was quite comprehensive in terms of deliverables we were required to accomplish. As such, it needed strong time management and group work skills in order to ensure each task was effectively completed. A mix of individual and group work while also incorporating weekly meetings during tutorial times ensured everyone was always on the same page. In addition to the soft skills, it required applying knowledge that had been built in 2nd and 3rd year chemical engineering. The fact that I was able to successfully do this helped to build confidence in my abilities as a chemical engineering student.
