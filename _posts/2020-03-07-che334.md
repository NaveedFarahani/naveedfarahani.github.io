Description of course:
This course focuses on teaching students how to effectively work within a team to solve a problem. Student teams are expected to develop a design proposal for the successful production of a selected chemical. This includes incorporating learned Chemical Engineering skills by creating PFDs, P&ID’s, operating procedures and health and safety protocols.

Description of our project:
A design proposal for a facility for cyclohexanol production from 1-hexanol feedstock, which included the design of the reactor, the design of the distillation column, P&ID development, and the control strategies implemented to mitigate process deviations.

Reflection
Project required applying knowledge that has been built in 2nd and 3rd year chemical engineering – successfully doing so helped to build confidence in my abilities as a chemical engineering student
