After my 2nd year of school, I worked as a summer student for Hatch in their technologies department. The 4 months I spent at the company were immensely helpful in building my skills as a young professional. As part of the team, I devoted most of my summer to completing a research project on the thermal properties of a specific material, writing current state reports, developing a new SharePoint team site, and conducting any other ad-hoc tasks required of me. While these are better explained in my resume, the hard skills I worked on can be summarized as: experimental planning and implementation, technical research and report writing. 

In addition to work, I also played for the company soccer team, not only was it good physical activity but it allowed me to meet people in different groups within Hatch and learn about what they did.
