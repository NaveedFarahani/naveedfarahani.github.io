**Course Description:**<br>
This was a 2nd year course focused on teaching students about the chemical mechanisms that govern the natural environment. It included in-depth content on the atmosphere, water, and soil. The course featured a culminating group project, where as part of a team, I developed and presented a Phase 2 Environmental Site Assessment proposal

**Project Description:**<br>
Our team was tasked with developing a plan for establishing a baseline for airborne contaminants in the Toronto Portlands, as well as a continuing monitoring strategy.

**Reflection:**<br>
The project was my first experience in creating a professional proposal, this included learning how to estimate work timelines and budgets. It also helped me to practice the familiar technical research/writing and group work skills. The project also enabled us to meet with and learn from industry professionals, and continue building related soft skills.

**Testimony**
> “A solid rock throughout the project. Fulfilled all his parts and was always present during team meetings and discussion. No complaints about too much work, no complaints about work being too difficult. You find a way to get things done. Dependable, and able to work independently. A team member everyone needs in their lives.”
