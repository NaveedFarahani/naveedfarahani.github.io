**Reflection:**<br>
Learned what is needed in a professional proposal, in addition to the familiar technical research/writing, needed to learn how to estimate work timelines and budget. An opportunity to present to industry professionals, and continue building related soft skills. Continued to gain experience on working within a group

**Testimony**
> “A solid rock throughout the project. Fulfilled all his parts and was always present during team meetings and discussion. No complaints about too much work, no complaints about work being too difficult. You find a way to get things done. Dependable, and able to work independently. A team member everyone needs in their lives.”
