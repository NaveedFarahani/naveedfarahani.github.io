In 2019, after my 3rd year of Chemical Engineering, I took a break from my studies and completed my Professional Experience Year (PEY). I had been accepted as PEY Student at CIBC as an analyst in their Enterprise Process Management department. I was a part of the process engineering team which was geared towards delivering continuous improvement to all areas of the bank's operations. The 15 months I spent at CIBC provided me a lot of experience in data analysis and problem solving; I learned new process metholodgies while receiving my Green Belt training. My Excel and Powerpoint skills improved significantly. Most of all, I worked on my professional soft skills. There were multiple opoprtunities to present to senior management, and I learned more about condensing and conveying only the necessary information that the leaders need to know in a limited timeframe. On the more fun side of things, I also had joined the spirit committee and got to plan monthly socials and holiday events for the entire team. Looking back, beyond the valuable skills I picked up, it was an extremely welcoming environment, everyday, I got to learn from very knowledgeable and helpful coworkers.
