In my first year of engineering at UofT, I had to take a design course called APS112 Engineering Strategies and Practice II (you can briefly read about it here). Building upon first semester, that course had been an opportunity to apply the engineering design methodology to a real-world problem. In many ways, this Capstone was an extension of that experience – the entire course depended on our team being able to successfully apply our knowledge to the situation. Reflecting on this, there were a lot of skills I was able to work on during this past year. The Project Requirements had required extensive research to sufficiently scope our project. The Design Proposal built on that research, and also necessitated some mathematical skills I had learned in other courses and also decision-making skills by using matrices and voting tools to democratically select the alternative and proposed designs. For the Design Review, it was mixture of presentation and PowerPoint skills and also being able to answer our client’s questions on the fly. The Final Design Report had project management/organization skills in order to ensure everything came together smoothly, there were valuable learning experiences in the HAZID and impact assessments, and more PowerPoint when designing the infographic. Similar to the Design Review, the Showcase and Final Meeting were once again chances to improve upon presentation abilities. 

Besides the skills required to complete each deliverable, I also needed to be able to work effectively as part of cohesive team that unfortunately could not have in-person contact. This made the group’s forming stage more challenging that it would have been in other years. As someone who tends to be shyer, I found it difficult at first to bond, but over time I improved. This can be seen in the form of the team member feedback that was completed at 3 different intervals throughout the course. 

**1st TELS Survey**

> “Your ability to communicate when challenges arise and be open to different ideas is really appreciated and I think this leads to both a better team dynamic and a better design. Possibly consider working on communicating more during meetings and sharing your ideas more often with the team - I think that you are great at being honest about problems that arise but likely have other opinions that may not be being heard during the meetings. These could be really helpful in getting a more diverse viewpoint on different design aspects.”

The feedback from the 1st interval was very important for me going forward in the project. I knew where my shortcomings with communication could be but having it in front of me was an impetus to work harder on improving it. I’ve always found it difficult to be outspoken on my opinions even when I’m not fully in agreeance on an idea. In virtual meetings, it’s easier to stay silent, but I know that it’s not great for me nor the team to do so. My goal at this point was, beyond continuing to complete the required work at a high-quality standard, I was going to focus on improving my verbal contributions to the team meetings.

**2nd TELS Survey**

> “I noticed that you are working to take a more active role in meetings and on the project in general. This has been really great, as for the last few meetings it has felt like the collaboration within the team has been improving - and your ideas and comments have been part of this progress. I think if you can keep communicating during meetings and providing insight, this would be really beneficial!”

My conscious approach to working on my communication showed in the second survey. I felt that I had the made the improvement as well by being more responsive in meetings and offering my thoughts. The issue now became less of shyness but moreso being confident in what I had to say. We were all working on the same project, and the broad nature of what needed to get done meant, each team member specialized in certain areas - especially for the Final Design Report.

**3rd TELS Survey**

> “Naveed, you are a super accountable teammate, and I am always impressed with the work you do. I think that you could be more confident and direct with your thoughts and opinions, especially on the parts of the project that are your expertise. It was a pleasure working with you and all the best next year!”

In following from above, having confidence in myself is still an area of improvement. I know that I can perform and get the work done at a high standard, but I need to be able to communicate that to others as well.

Overall, my experience participating in the Multidisciplinary Capstone program was a positive one! I enjoyed working my team members, I liked the project we completed, and ultimately I'm proud of our end result. I think it was a very valuable experience that added to my personal and professional development and it is something I will always look back on fondly.
