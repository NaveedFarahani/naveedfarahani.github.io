Description of course:
1st year course focused on teaching students about the engineering design process. Students are split into groups and spend the semester working on a design project for a given client. The course culminated in a presentation of the group’s proposed design.

Description of our project:
Our client was the organization, Multidisciplinary Analytical Kinesthetic Education (M.A.K.E.). An affiliated University of Toronto Engineering club, they designed and hosted events throughout the year targeting first year students. They challenge students with mini projects that cover engineering concepts, with the aim of helping students to understand them better. Our challenge was to design a mini project that M.A.K.E could use at an event.

Reflection:
An opportunity to apply not only apply the material learned from APS112 in order to complete each deliverable, but the very nature of the project meant it was also a chance to reflect on my own understanding of other 1st year courses. Another great experience of working within a team setting

Testimony
> “Raised discussion on issues in documents, to generate new ideas, and awareness for situation. Completed tasks on time and tried to assist others. Always trying to make sure that our documents not only had what was required but tried to push the quality by asking the T.A where we could improve or if we were doing something right.”
