Summary:<br>
The Final Design Report (FDR) is the main component of the course as it is a fully detailed breakdown of our proposed solution. In addition to this, we included multiple other important elements such as the bill of materials, cost analysis, safety analysis, ergonomics analysis, impact assessment, instruction manuals, CAD files, and assembly drawings. The report is meant to be a comprehensive document that the client can refer to, if they choose to continue with further research and development of our design. 

My Work:<br>
In order to ensure we completed all necessary tasks and within the required timeframe, our team broke down deliverable into several phases and internal deadlines. In additional to ad-hoc editing and review of other sections, my main roles included participating in the safety analysis and the impact assessment, writing portions of the user manual and creating the accompanying infographic. 

For the safety analysis, we decided that the best option was to conduct a HAZID assessment on our design. As a part of a smaller team of 3, we examined every “node” of the intended operation cycle, generating potential hazards and then developing possible safeguards or prevention strategies. Hazards were prioritized using a risk rating we created based on the product of the severity and likelihood of it occurring. Our findings were presented to the team that would incorporate the adjustments into the final design. Having learned and used HAZID as a tool for a 3rd year course, this was a good chance to build upon and apply my knowledge to an idea that had not been structured by a professor. Below are____.

Once our design was finalized, I worked with a partner to complete an impact assessment of the solution focusing on the social and environmental effects. Besides the research and technical writing component of this section, I was able to learn a new skill, calculating the CO2 equivalent for our design. My partner and I broke down our design into as many base materials as possible, then found the CO2 equivalent for each in order to determine an approximate value. The assessment was an important piece to complete because it reminded me that creating a solution does not stop at just making a functional design, it can still fail if the proper audience and environment is not considered. Below is the table we generated that breaks down the CO2 equivalent for our design.

The user manual built upon the general operating procedures that our team had created while designing our solution. We used other instruction manuals as a basis to determine what we needed to include. What made it difficult was the fact that we did not have a chance to create a physical prototype. As such every instruction required us to use our imagination and walk through the design, thinking of how best to attach every component, what step should come first if maintenance is required, etc. Additionally, the language needed to be concise and clear, even though our targeted audience was GlobalMedic workers it still must be easy to understand to ensure accidents do not occur. Below is an excerpt of a line from the manual. 

For the infographic, I had one page (front and back) to visualize the assembly, operation, and maintenance of our design. To complete this task, I began by working with my partner on the manual to storyboard each process with rough sketches. With an idea in mind of what I wanted to do; I was able to get help from our team’s CAD expert to create some of the more detailed visuals that I could not accomplish on PowerPoint.  The main challenge was ensuring in limited space that one could understand what needed to be done. To this end, I reached out to friends outside of my project team to receive their feedback – this was especially important as feedback from the team was biased in already having background knowledge. I also drew inspiration from the nature of IKEA manuals that use visuals over words to provide instruction. In final feedback we received from our client, I was extremely pleased to hear a comment about the infographic feeling like an IKEA manual. Below is the backside of the infographic detailing maintenance procedures.
