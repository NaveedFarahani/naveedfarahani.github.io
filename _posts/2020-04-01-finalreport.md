•	Project Requirements
o	For this milestone, needed to create a project scope, understand the service environment/stakeholders, and detail functions, objectives, constraints of any design.
o	My Role 
	Took on a research and writing role by defining the Service Environment
o	Reflection
	Difficult at first to determine the appropriate level of detail for a design that is needed on a global basis
	It was a great reminder that to create a successful and safe design you need to consider every relevant factor
	Fortunately, we have a great project supervisor and client who agreed to meet with us before the deadline and help to answer our questions
