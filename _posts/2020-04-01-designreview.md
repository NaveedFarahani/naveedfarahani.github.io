o	Present our proposed design to the client and our project supervisor in a 30-minute presentation timespan
o	The goal was to walkthrough our team’s design process and how we had reached our proposal
o	My Role
	Had 2 roles
•	Create the portion of the presentation detailing the proposed design from a chemical component standpoint (i.e., the purification unit)
o	paring down what we had wrote in the Design Proposal document
•	Create the slide deck
o	Began by creating a template that contained all the parts we needed to include
o	Had each team member add the content that they want simply in note form
o	Took everything and redesigned to fit one theme, added visuals as needed
o	The main challenge was ensuring each slide conveyed the right message
o	Reflection
	Want to focus on the slide creation, had spent decent amount of my PEY creating slide decks for different meetings, in first semester had worked on more low-end visuals in different projects.
	It was a lot of fun to work on because it offered a bit of a creative outlet in figuring out to how to convey everything visually, also was a big departure from the document writing that we had been doing
	The actual meeting went really well, we were all prepared and presented without hiccups, we were able to answer the clients’ questions and came away with the feeling that they were onboard with our progress and that we were trending in the right direction with our design
	Had not only had our client contact but also the Executvie director of the organization, so presented to higher ups
	Can do a reflection related to TELS
•	In regards to the last TELS had taken a conscious step towards being more active during group meetings as seen in the TELS survey
o	Testimonies to that
	“I noticed that you are working to take a more active role in meetings and on the project in general. This has been really great, as for the last few meetings it has felt like the collaboration within the team has been improving - and your ideas and comments have been part of this progress. I think if you can keep communicating during meetings and providing insight, this would be really beneficial!”
	Find rubric comments
