o	Brainstormed and developed several alternative designs that are meet the required FOCs – use decision making methods to choose the best design
	chose to separately design purification and pumping mechanisms
o	My Role
	Researched and created one of the design alternatives
•	Focused on developing a viable method of using a combination of carbon filtration and boiling to purify the water
o	Reflection
	It was both exciting and stressful to try to come up with a design that utilized boiling and carbon filtration. I initially had hoped to develop a unique design. 
	Insert photos of rough sketches showing carbon filter design work
	The design required more details than what could be provided at that stage, and after some rough calculations of estimated material costs, I realized an off the shelf solution would better meet the project FOCs
	After researching boiling, I determined that it simply would not be possible to achieve large scale boiling off using only human power to meet the desired output rate.
	Voiced these concerns to the team and as a group we decided to remove it as an alternative, and instead focus on using carbon filtration as an additional stage for the other alternative designs
o	As a team critically assessed each alternative using decision matrices 
	Insert example of matrix completed
o	Resulted in choosing a combination of a mechanical step pedal and an ultrafiltration unit
	Insert photo of this design 
•	Personal Progression	
o	Aiming to use this section to show growth and improvement throughout the project’s length
o	Highlight one of the comments from the 1st TELS survey 
	“Your ability to communicate when challenges arise and be open to different ideas is really appreciated and I think this leads to both a better team dynamic and a better design. Possibly consider working on communicating more during meetings and sharing your ideas more often with the team - I think that you are great at being honest about problems that arise but likely have other opinions that may not be being heard during the meetings. These could be really helpful in getting a more diverse viewpoint on different design aspects.”
o	This is definitely an area of improvement for me, I’ve always found it difficult to be outspoken on my opinions even when I’m not fully in agreeance on an idea. In virtual meetings, it’s easier to stay silent, but I know that it’s not great for me nor the team to do so.
o	Going forward, beyond continuing to complete the required work at a high-quality standard, I’m going to focus on improving my verbal contributions to the team meetings. I aim to show this with the next TELS survey.
•	Next Steps
o	As of right now, the team is working on refining our design and creating a prototype ahead of a key client presentation in early January 2021!
