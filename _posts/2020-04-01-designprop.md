After the project requirements were complete, the step was the more exciting one â€“ brainstorming and developing possible solutions. Due to the fact that our team was split evenly between chemical and mechanical students, we thought it was best to separate ideation into the mechanism needed to pump water and the one needed to purify the water. As part of the purification team, initially we focused on researching and listing down as many methods as possible. To this end, I spent time aggregating online information from various sources including companies, news publications, academic sources, etc. We determined there to be several main types of purification: chemical, light, heat, and filtration. At this point the work was divided, and I spent time further researching specifically filtration methods. I created half-page summaries of the various sub-types, ensuring to detail how they work and a rough evaluation in comparison to our objectives/constraints. I then presented them to my team members and through multi-voting we decided on 3 purification methods to continue pursuing. Below is the FOC evalution from my half-page summary of ceramic filtration.

> Ceramic filters are effective at removing some microorganisms (bacteria, protozoa, helminths), some iron, reducing turbidity, and improving taste, odour, and colour. When treated with colloidal silver, there is an increased ability to remove viruses. Adding activated carbon, allows chlorine and VOCs to be removed (173). Maintenance is done by scrubbing the unit with a brush to avoid build up. A ceramic pot can last 1-2 years, however durability is a concern as units can be easily damaged; cracks or chips will require replacement. Capital cost for a ceramic pot is dependent on local production and can range from $15 to $25 (175). Replacement filters can cost between $4 to $6 (175). Current designs have a small capacity of approximately 8 to 10 L, and a slow flow rate of 1-3 L/hour (170). If water turbidity is greater than 50 NTU, pre-filtering is required to reduce sediment levels.

Next, I was tasked with the developing a viable design alternative based on a combination of carbon filtration and boiling to purify the water. Using the flowrate constraint, I began working backwards to determine what type of setup would be required to make it work. I soon realized that to design a brand-new carbon filter (i.e., choose the type of media, and size a housing unit) required more details than what could be provided at that stage, and after some rough calculations of estimated material costs, I realized an off the shelf solution would better meet the project FOCs. Below is an example of the calculations I performed while doing this. 

Furthermore, I needed to ensure that any design not only fit our purification FOCs but would also be compatible with any mechanical pumping design. This was especially relevant in terms of power requirement. After researching boiling, I determined that it simply would not be possible to achieve large scale boiling off using only human power to meet the desired output rate. Once again, I made sure to promptly voice my concerns with the team, and as a group we decided to remove it as an alternative, and instead focus on using carbon filtration as an additional stage for the other alternative designs. The image below is taken from my portion of the report detailing the inclusion of carbon filtration in several alternative designs.

Ultimately, through a matrix decision process, our group decided on using ultrafiltration as the purification method, and a step pedal as the pumping mechanism.
