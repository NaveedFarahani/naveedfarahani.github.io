APS490Y or Multi-Disciplinary Capstone Design is a 4th year course that I applied to take where students are grouped with peers from other disciplines and mandated a client’s problem to solve using the engineering design process. I wanted to take this course because I was interested in working with others outside my own discipline and also because I was excited at the prospect of designing a product an actual client. I would end up as a part of a team of 6: 3 Chemical Engineering and 3 Mechanical Engineering students, working on a very exciting project.

My team’s client was GlobalMedic, a Canadian charity that provides global humanitarian aid to communities that have been affected by natural disasters. A major element of their relief responses is providing access to clean drinking water. At the moment, the organization relies upon an external company’s battery powered purification units to purify water for entire communities. GlobalMedic also has gravity powered units that can be employed in single household situations. However, the usage of motorized units presents a problem in scenarios where access to electricity or battery failures will make purification impossible. As such, GlobalMedic tasked our team with the job of creating a portable, human powered water purification device that could be used to provide clean water for entire communities. 

The team worked diligently on this problem for the entire school year, and each post that you can read here explores the different aspects of the journey from my perspective. For ease of understanding, please read in chronological order as follows:
